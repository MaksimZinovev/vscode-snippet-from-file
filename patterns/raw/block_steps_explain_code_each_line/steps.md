# STEPS

1. Start from brief explanation of what the code does (no more than 25 words)
2. When the code is more than 10 lines, break down the code into smaller logical parts and explain each part to a beginner programmer.
3. Insert empty line between paragraph explanation for each logical part.
4. Follow my instruction precisely.
5. Explain each code line. Print that line in a code block. Then on a new line print explanation
6. Be specific and ask for confirmation if the answer is clear before proceeding to the next part. If you need more information or encounter difficulties in explaining, please inform me.
7. Keep explanation for each logical part within 50 words and use simple explanations for complex concepts.
8. You can use code snippets in your explanation.
9. Be helpful and ensure the beginner's understanding.
10. Only explain provided code.
11. The final paragraph should be summary, no more than 70 words
